\section{Photometry of Ellipticals}

The surface brightness profile of elliptical galaxies typically is similar to the Sersic profile.  Re-writting
the standard Sersic profile in terms of an effective radius $\Reff$, we have

\begin{equation}
I(R) = I(\Reff)\exp\{-b[(R/\Reff)^{1/n}-1]\}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $b\approx 1.999n-0.327$ for $n>1$ is a constant that gives $\Reff$ containing half the light.


\section{Shapes of Ellipticals}

The density of stars in an oblate spheroid $\rho(\vx)$ can be written
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:spheroid}
\rho(\vx) = \rho(m^2)~~\mathrm{where}~~m^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{A^2}+\frac{z^2}{B^2}
\end{equation}
\noindent
and $A>B>0$.  The isodensity contours are ellipsoids with $m^2 = $constant.

{\bf See figure 6.8 of Sparke and Gallagher}

When determining the axis ratio $q=b/a$, w place the observer in the $x-z$ plane
looking at an angle $0^\circ < i < 90^\circ$ to the $z$ axis.
The line of sight hits the isodensity surface $m^2 = x^2 / A^2 + z^2/B^2$ 
at the tangent point T, so we have
\begin{equation}
\tan i = dx/dz = -(z/x)(A^2/B^2)
\end{equation}
\noindent
The elliptical image has a semi-major axis $a=mA$.  It's semi-minor
axis is $b=OR=OQ\sin i$.  We then have
\begin{equation}
OQ = OP+PQ = z+(-x)\cot i = B^2m^2/z
\end{equation}
\noindent
and the observed axis ratio is
\begin{equation}
q_{obl} \equiv \frac{b}{a} = \frac{OQ \sin i}{mA} = \frac{B^2 m}{zA}\sin i = \left(\frac{B^2}{A^2} + \cot^2 i\right)^{1/2}\sin i
\end{equation}
\noindent
therefore
\begin{equation}
q_{obl}^2 = (b/a)^2 = (B/A)^2\sin^2 i + \cos^2 i
\end{equation}
\noindent
which means that an oblate spheroid never appears more flattened than its true axis ratio $A/B$.
A prolate spheroid can be described by Equation \ref{eqn:spheroid} with $A<B$.  In this case
\begin{equation}
q_{prol}^2 = [(B/A)^2 \sin^2 i + \cos^2 i]^{-1}
\end{equation}
\noindent
and $q_{prol}>A/B$.  The flattening is not more than the true axis ratio.

We can integrate over inclination $i$ to determine the distribution $f(q)$ of observed axis
ratios in the range $q +\Delta q$ given true axes $A,B$.  In the oblong case:
\begin{equation}
f_{obl}(q) \Delta q = \frac{\sin i \cdot \Delta q}{|dq/di|} = \frac{q\Delta q}{\sqrt{1-(B/A)^2}\sqrt{q^2-(B/A)^2}}
\end{equation}
\noindent
For very flattened systems ($B\ll A$) this distribution is almost uniform.  
For disks, there are not many as flattened as $q=0.1$. There
are no ellipticals flatter than $q=0.3$ (E7).
Galaxies with $M_B~-20$ have $q\approx0.75$. Galaxies with $M_B<-20$ have $q\approx0.85$.

Some bright galaxies are probably triaxial
\begin{equation}
\rho(\vx) = \rho(m^2)~~\mathrm{where}~~m^2 = \frac{x^2}{A^2} + \frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2}
\end{equation}
\noindent
The cross-section in any plane perpendicular to the principal axes is an ellipse.


\section{Isophotal Shapes}

The isophotes of ellipticals can change their shape as a function of
radius.  There are {\it disky} ellipticals with extra light along the major axis.
Others appear {\it boxy} with more light in the ``corners'' of the ellipse.
Consider a given isophote.  We can write the ellipse of that best matches this isophote as
\begin{equation}
x = a \cos t;~y=b\cos t
\end{equation}
\noindent
Let $\Delta r(t)$ describe the distance between the ellipse and the isophote.  We
can write
\begin{equation}
\Delta r(t) \approx \Sigma_{k\ge3} a_k \cos(k t) + b_k \sin(kt)
\end{equation}
\noindent
where the $k<3$ terms vanish because we are considering the best-fit ellipse.
Terms $a_3$ and $b_3$ are usually small and describe ``egg-shaped'' isophotes.
The term $b_4$ is usually small but $a_4$ is not.  If $a_4>0$, the
isophote is disky and lies beyond the ellipse on the major and minor axes, 
whereas $a_4<0$ gives a boxy isophote that bulges out at $45^{\circ}$ relative
to the major and minor axes.
